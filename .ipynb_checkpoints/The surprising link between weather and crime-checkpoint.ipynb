    "Last week, I came across [this article](http://crime.static-eric.com/) which talked about the link between weather and crime: apparently, higher temperatures are correlated with higher crime rates. This is one of those things that you know could be true and yet don't *sound* true- like the fact that Donald Trump's campaign manager was indicted for certain crimes, and this is true, because he made changes to a document in MS Word from his own username, and the prosecutors - experienced, intelligent criminal lawyers - used 'Track Changes'.\n",
    "\n",
    "On digging a little more, I found a large body of findings and possible explanations for why this might be the case - [this study](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/01/opinion/sunday/weather-and-violence.html) reported in the New York Times talked about how extreme weather events always lead to an increase in violence. [This article](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/data/ct-crime-heat-analysis-htmlstory.html) in the Chicago Tribune also talks about an increase in violent crimes. [This article](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170925132948.htm) links violence to all increases in temperature - even warmer winter days. There is a variety of explanations - from [sociological](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4760/63974fc8703e2e4157153e77898bc89d92b5.pdf) to [neuroscientific](https://grist.org/climate-energy/hunting-for-the-neuroscience-of-heat-and-violence/) to simple (higher temperature => more people outside => more opportunities for crime => more crime).\n"

    "The Atlanta police department hosts datasets of all crimes reported, by year, [here](http://www.atlantapd.org/i-want-to/crime-data-downloads). They also, sadly, store their 2018 dataset once labeled as 2012, so I can consider only the five years between 2013-17. The data lists 11 types of violent crime. I'm only interested in the sum total of all crimes, so let's just look at the trend in the total daily crime over the years:"
