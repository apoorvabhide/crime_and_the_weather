    "Last week, I came across [this article](http://crime.static-eric.com/) which talked about the link between weather and crime: apparently, higher temperatures are correlated with higher crime rates. This is one of those things that you know could be true and yet don't *sound* true- like the fact that Donald Trump's campaign manager was indicted for certain crimes, and this is true, because he made changes to a document in MS Word from his own username, and the prosecutors - experienced, intelligent criminal lawyers - used 'Track Changes'.\n",
    "\n",
    "On digging a little more, I found a large body of findings and possible explanations for why this might be the case - [this study](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/01/opinion/sunday/weather-and-violence.html) reported in the New York Times talked about how extreme weather events always lead to an increase in violence. [This article](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/data/ct-crime-heat-analysis-htmlstory.html) in the Chicago Tribune also talks about an increase in violent crimes. [This article](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170925132948.htm) links violence to all increases in temperature - even warmer winter days. There is a variety of explanations - from [sociological](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4760/63974fc8703e2e4157153e77898bc89d92b5.pdf) to [neuroscientific](https://grist.org/climate-energy/hunting-for-the-neuroscience-of-heat-and-violence/) to simple (higher temperature => more people outside => more opportunities for crime => more crime).\n"

    "For the record, before you start, I know this correlation doesn't imply causation. I'm not trying to prove higher temperature causes higher crime. I have neither the intention nor the 30-year experience in sociology to do that. I'm just marveling at how damn cool it is that the correlation exists in the first place."
